"""Is this binary search tree a valid BST?

A valid binary search tree follows a specific rule. In our case,
the rule is "left child must value must be less-than parent-value"
and "right child must be greater-than-parent value".

This rule is recursive, so *everything* left of a parent
must less than that parent (even grandchildren or deeper)
and everything right of a parent must be greater than.

For example, this tree is valid::

        4
     2     6
    1 3   5 7

Let's create this tree and test that::

    >>> t = Node(4,
    ...       Node(2, Node(1), Node(3)),
    ...       Node(6, Node(5), Node(7))
    ... )

    >>> t.is_valid()
    True

This tree isn't valid, as the left-hand 3 is wrong (it's less
than 2)::

        4
     2     6
    3 3   5 7

Let's make sure that gets caught::

    >>> t = Node(4,
    ...       Node(2, Node(3), Node(3)),
    ...       Node(6, Node(5), Node(7))
    ... )

    >>> t.is_valid()
    False

This tree is invalid, as the bottom-right 1 is wrong --- it is
less than its parent, 6, but it's also less than its grandparent,
4, and therefore should be left of 4::

        4
     2     6
    1 3   1 7

    >>> t = Node(4,
    ...       Node(2, Node(1), Node(3)),
    ...       Node(6, Node(1), Node(7))
    ... )

    >>> t.is_valid()
    False
